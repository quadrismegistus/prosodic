immured is the store\nWhich should example where your equal grew.\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory;\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story,\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\nMaking his style admired every where.\nYou to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\nBeing fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\n\n\n\n# now we can look at \"worst\" sonnet\nsonnets.stanza51\n\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence\nOf my dull bearer when from thee I speed:\nFrom where thou art why should I haste me thence?\nTill I return, of posting is no need.\nO, what excuse will my poor beast then find,\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\nThen should I spur, though mounted on the wind;\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know:\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace;\nTherefore desire of perfect'st love being made,\nShall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;\nSince from thee going he went wilful-slow,\nTowards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."
