Currently, it can parse English and Finnish text, but adding additional languages is easy with a pronunciation dictionary or a custom python function. Prosodic was built by Ryan Heuser, Josh Falk, and Arto Anttila. Josh also maintains another repository, in which he has rewritten the part of this project that does phonetic transcription for English and Finnish. Sam Bowman has contributed to the codebase as well, adding several new metrical constraints.\n“Prosodic 2”, in this develop branch, is a near-total rewrite of Prosodic.\nSupports Python&gt;=3.8."

This document covers how to get started using Prosodic in python.\nTo use within python, load jupyter or ipython:\nipython\nRecommended practice is to import with fullname.\n\nimport prosodic\n\n\nLoading texts\nYou can load a text by a URL or a filename pointing to a text file:\n\nsonnets = prosodic.Text('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quadrismegistus/prosodic/develop/corpora/corppoetry_en/en.shakespeare.txt')\n\nOr directly by a string:\n\nsonnet = prosodic.Text(\"\"\"\nThose hours, that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter, and confounds him there;\nSap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:\nThen were not summer’s distillation left,\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\nBut flowers distill’d, though they with winter meet,\nLeese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.\n\"\"\")\n\n\n\nExamining texts\nAny text when displayed will show the dataframe stored at its .df attribute:\n\n# the sonnet object displays as `sonnet.df`\nsonnet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nword_num_forms\nsyll_is_stressed\nsyll_is_heavy\nsyll_is_strong\nsyll_is_weak\nword_is_punc\n\n\nstanza_num\nline_num\nline_txt\nword_lang\nwordtoken_num\nwordtoken_txt\nwordform_num\nsyll_num\nsyll_txt\nsyll_ipa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nThose hours, that with gentle work did frame\nen\n1\nThose\n1\n1\nThose\nðoʊz\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nhours\n1\n1\nho\n'aʊ\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n2\nurs\nɛːz\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n2\n1\nhours\n'aʊrz\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n,\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n14\nLeese but their show;
