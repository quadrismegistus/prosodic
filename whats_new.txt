BUGFIXES:

- Fixed primary/secondary stress mismatch.

- Fixed orthographic/phonetic syllable-number mismatches with Finnish (I hope).

- Fixed some Unicode decoding errors: texts should work in ASCII or in Unicode now.

- Maybe fixed a parsing error when entries on a word differed in the number of syllables -- need to investigate more.



OUTPUT:

- "Meaningful" output [all output not about the functioning of the script] has been rerouted in the program,
	making it available for saving using a new command /save. Output will remain available for saving until
	a new meaningful output takes its place.

- Output can be "muted" anytime with the /mute command. When muted, output will remain hidden from the screen,
	but will still be available for /saving. This is useful before beginning to load a corpus for instance.

- The output generated when loading a text or corpus can now be arrived at by will using the /show command.

- The output generated when parsing has been changed to a tab-separated:
	the line	the|LINE	#parses	#viols	meter	[individual constraint violations]

- The above metrical output can also now be arrived at by will using the /scan command.

- The /stats command will save four tab-separated files of statistics from the metrical parser,
	one of which is in an OT-ready format.



CONFIG:

- A new configuration option "lang" can be set in config.txt to bypass the script's initial language-asking.

- A new configuration option "print_to_screen" will set the script to default as /mute or /unmute.

- A new configuration option "linelen" specifies the number of spaces certain outputs will "pad" their largest fields.
	Set to 0 to disable.




CODE:
- entity.py has been cleared of its history.

- Most of entity.py has been commented, working on the rest of the script.
