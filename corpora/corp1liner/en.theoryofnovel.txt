Only prose can then encompass the suffering and the laurels, the struggle and the crown, [the path and the consecration] with equal power; only its unfettered plasticity and non-rhythmic rigour can, with equal power, embrace the fetters and the freedom, the given heaviness and the conquered lightness of a world henceforth immanently radiant with found meaning.

the fetters and the freedom,
the given heaviness and the conquered lightness
of a world henceforth immanently radiant with found meaning
