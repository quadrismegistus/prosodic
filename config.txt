# [config.txt]
## here you may change the runtime settings for prosodic.
## if you have any questions, please email: ryan <heuser@stanford.edu> or josh <falkj@stanford.edu>



# [0. OVERVIEW]
## There are three main areas for which you may want to change the settings:
## 1. how the metrical parsing works (in the maximum size of metrical positions, and in the constraints);
## 2. the way in which texts are divided into 'lines' (which is the unit given to the metrical parser); 
## 3. how linguistic annotations are displayed (eg, the syllabification).


lang=en			# if set, will not ask for lang and assume everything english
#lang=fi		# if set, will not ask for lang and assume everything english
#lang=**		# if set, will not ask for lang, but will attempt to discover language and if fail, ask later



# [1. METRICAL PARSING]
## [1.1 Position Size]
## the number of syllables allowed per metrical position (cf. Kiparsky&Hanson's "position size" parameter)
maxS=2		#. the number of syllables allowed in a *strong* metrical position
maxW=2		#. the number of syllables allowed in a *weak* metrical position
#splitheavies=1		# allow positions to be as small as a single mora (a split heavy syllable across two metrical positions)
splitheavies=0		# positions are at least one syllable in size


## [1.2 Metrical Constraints]
## here you may set/unset the active constraints, by "commenting out" unwanted constraints with a # sign before them.
## you may assign constraints a numerical weight, by changing the number after the / in their name.
## for more information about these constraints, please see {"A Parametric Theory of Poetic Meter", Kiparsky & Hanson, Language, 1996}


#footmin-noHX/100		#. a disyllabic metrical position may not contain more than a minimal foot (ie allowed positions are weighted LL or LH)
#footmin-noLH-noHX/1			# a disyllabic metrical position prefers LL to LH. constraints nested to assist harmonic bounding.
#footmin-wordbound-bothnotfw/1		# in disyllabic metrical position crossing a word-boundary, satisfied only if both syllables are function-words.
#footmin-wordbound-neitherfw/5		#.? in disyllabic metrical position crossing a word-boundary, satisfied if one syllable is a function-word.
#footmin-wordbound-leftfw/1		# in disyllabic metrical position crossing a word-boundary, satisfied if left syllable is a function-word.
#footmin-wordbound-rightfw/1		# in disyllabic metrical position crossing a word-boundary, satisfied if right syllable is a function-word.

#strength.s=>-u/1			# a strong metrical position may not contain any weak syllables, or "troughs"
strength.w=>-p/103			# a weak metrical position may not contain any strong syllables, or "peaks" 
#strength.s=>p/5				# a *strong* metrical position must contain at least one syllable which is *prominent* in terms of *strength*
#strength.w=>u/1				# a *weak* metrical position must contain *at least one* syllable which is *unprominent* in terms of *strength*

#stress.s=>-u/1				# a *strong* metrical position may not contain *any* unstressed syllables
#stress.w=>-p/5				#. a *weak* metrical position may not contain *any* stressed syllables
#stress.s=>p/5				# a *strong* position must contain *at least one* stressed syllable
#stress.w=>u/5				# a *weak* position must contain *at least one* unstressed syllable

#weight.s=>-u/1				# a *strong* metrical position may not contain *any* light syllable#s
#weight.w=>-p/1				# a *weak* metrical position may not contain *any* heavy syllables
#weight.s=>p/1				# a *strong* metrical position must contain *at least one* heavy syllable
#weight.w=>u/1				# a *weak* metrical position must contain *at least one* light syllable
#kalevala.s=>-u/1			# a *strong* metrical position may not contain *any* -prom.kalevala syllables

#new (Sam Bowman)

footmin-none/1		#. a disyllabic metrical position may not contain more than a minimal foot (ie allowed positions are weighted LL or LH)

footmin-wordbound-nomono/102		#.? in disyllabic metrical position crossing a word-boundary, neither word can be a monosyllable.

footmin-strongconstraint/101		#.? A disyllabic metrical position may contain a strong syllable of a lexical word only if the syllable is (i) light and (ii) followed within the same position by an unstressed syllable normally belonging to the same word.

functiontow/1				# a function word can fall only in a weak position

initialstrong/10000			# an initial syllable must be in a weak position


## [1.3 Maximal Line-Size]
## you may also set the minimum and maximum "sizes" (in terms of syllable-count) of the lines you would like to parse.
## this helps prevent the parser from hanging on the occasional very long line.
line_minsylls=8
line_maxsylls=20
resolve_optionality=1		# resolve syllabification/stress/weight optionalities by letting them compete among the parses
#resolve_optionality=0


## line headedness: [optional] force parser to select best parse from the lowest-scoring parse which beguns as such:
line_headedness=sw
#line_headedness=ws
#line_headedness=wws
#line_headedness=ssw



# [2. LINE-DIVISIONS]
## here you may decide how texts divide into lines by leaving uncommented your preferred method.
## this is significant only because the line, with its words and syllables, is the unit passed to the metrical parser.
linebreak=line					# linebreaks occur only at actual line-breaks in the processed text file (good for metrical poetry);
#linebreak=,;:.?!()[]{}<>		# linebreaks occur only upon encountering any of these punctuation marks (good for prose);
#linebreak=line,;:.?!()[]{}<>	# linebreaks occur both at actual-linebreaks, and at any of these punctuation marks (good for prose and free-verse poetry).
tokenizer=[^\s+-]+          # words tokenized against [^] whitespaces [\s+] and hyphens [-]
#tokenizer=[^\s+]+          # words tokenized against [^] whitespaces [\s+]


# [3.0 OUTPUT-FORMATTING]
## here you may change the format under which the syllabified, "pronunciation" output will appear.
## options are:
## 	ipa
## 	cmu (the formatting used in the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary)
## 	orth (the orthography itself [good for Finnish])
## this is a language-specific option, in order to take into account the differing relationships languages' orthographies have to their phonetics.
output_**=ipa		# the catch-all option, for all languages not explicitly defined below
output_en=cmu		# since our english information comes from the cmu, we default this to its native CMU
output_fi=orth		# since finnish pronunciation is essentially identical to its orthography


print_to_screen=1	# set to 1 to print words, parses, etc to screen; set to 0 to hide them; either way, you may save any output, hidden or not, using the /save command.
linelen=60

## [appendix: how this file works]
# any line with a pound (#) to the utmost left is considered a 'comment' and ignored;
# if multiple uncommented settings for the same variable, the last is taken
